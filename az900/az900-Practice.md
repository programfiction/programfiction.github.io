3. Your company’s finance department pays a large upfront cost for services and equipment. The value of the services and equipment reduces over time.

   Which type of investment approach is the company using?
   * Present Value (PV)
   * Capital Expenditure or Expenses (CapEx)
   * Operational Expenditure or Expenses (OpEx)
   * Return on Investment (ROI)

   <details>
   <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    
   The company is using Capital Expenditure or Expenses (CapEx). CapEx refers to deducting the expense of physical infrastructure from your tax bill. CapEx is marked down as an asset on the balance sheet and is viewed as an investment. This upfront cost is treated as an asset and will depreciate over time; thus, the value of the CapEx also reduces over time.

   Operational Expenditure or Expenses (OpEx) are items such as services or products that are being billed for and paid for as they are acquired. OpEx are expenses that can be deducted from your tax bill in the same year. Unlike CapEx, which is an upfront cost, with OpEx you pay for a service or product as you consume it.

   Return on Investment (ROI) is the difference (gain or loss) that is created relative to the amount of money that was allocated for the investment. The formula for ROI is the net profit or net loss divided by the total investment.

   Present Value (PV) is the value of the future income stream that is determined on the date of valuation. The present value of an investment is equal to or less than the future value of the investment because money has interest-earning potential.

4. Your company’s Chief Financial Officer wants to have a tighter control on spending for the cloud infrastructure.

   She wants to have a tool to estimate the up-front costs associate with the Azure cloud. An associate recommends that she use Azure Cost Management.

   Will this solution meet the CFO’s needs?
   * No
   * Yes
   <details>
   <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    
   Azure Cost Management does not estimate your up-front cloud costs. The Azure Pricing Calculator is a tool that can perform that task.

   Azure Cost Management consists of Cost Management + Billing, which is a suite of tools that optimizes, analyzes, and manages your workload costs. You can use these tools to perform the following tasks:

   * Streamline bill paying tasks
   * Managing costs
   * Download cost and usage data from your invoice
   * Use data analysis to monthly costs
   * Limit spending through the use of thresholds
   * Find opportunities for changes in workloads that can reduce spending

5. You company’s legal team wants to investigate whether your company complies with regulations regarding storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data. The legal team wants to know how the company’s e-commerce application adheres to these regulations.

   Where can the legal team learn more about this?
   * Product Terms site
   * Governance Benchmark tool
   * Azure compliance documentation site
   <details>
   <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    
   The Azure compliance documentation site (Azure compliance documentation | Microsoft Docs) allows the legal team to view all compliance documentation that adheres to the PCI DSS compliance. PCI DSS is a data security standard that payment industry stakeholders use. On the Azure compliance documentation site, you can find global compliance, US government compliance, financial compliance, healthcare compliance, and compliance in other industries.

You can use the site to query the terms relevant to the Product(s) that you have purchased in a specific licensing program. You can also find detailed information on a product or service.
