Need to pay for VMs(virtual machines instances, storage and networking resources Kubernetes cluster) | Deploy the containerized app with your preferred dependencies to production in seconds. You need to pay only for App plan |
   | Scale  | User need configure, Scalable with container groups | Scalable solution by design, built-in application autoscaling  | Is also scalable. user need to select special App plan  |
   | Monitor and diagnostic tools | ACI provides container logs and few alert diagrams but it is not enough |  full control with VMs can remote control or use tools like Kudu to connect to monitor | few alerts and Kudu tool to analyze, can monitor App plan service |
