## Azure Resource Groups
[Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.

The resource group stores metadata about the resources. Therefore, when you specify a location for the resource group, you are specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.

Advantages of Azure Resource Group
 - Resources share the same life cycle.
 - Resources can only exist in one resource group
 - Resources can communicate across resource groups.
 - Containers for security boundaries.
 - Azure policies can be defined for all resource in a group
 - Can export infrastructure-as-code using Resource manager templates
 - Resources can remain in different regions 

Create Azure Group from CLI : [Azure Cli](../az900/AzureCliCommands.md)

## Azure Resource manager :
[Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.
![Location](../az900/ARM.PNG)

4 ways of using Azure resource manager:
- Install and use [Azure Cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)
- Azure Portal
- Azure Powershell
- Rest Interface

Advantages of using resource manager :
- manages your infrastructure through declarative template rather than scripts.
- Deploy, manage and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually. 
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state. 
- Defines dependencies between resources so they are deployed in the correct order
- Apply access control to all services because Azure role based access control is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Apply tags to resources t logically organize all the resources in your subscription. 
Clarify your organization billing by viewing costs for a group of resources share the same tag.

## Infrastructure as code using Azure resource manager template 
Benefits of using infra as code are

   - Combines IT operation and development 
   - Infra is managed by code
   - Can be stored and versioned in code repositories 
   - Can be included in CI/CD pipeline

This is written in JSON, defines infra and configuration for Azure resources and Declarative syntax.

Deployment 
   - Using Azure Pipeline
   - From Github
   - Using PowerShell and the Azure Cli
   - Resources manager REST API
   - Using the Azure portal

Export & Deploy a resource management template with parameters description in template [Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax).

## Azure Service health
[Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/)
Azure service health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues in Azure services are or may effect in future. Azure service health is composed of 3 items
   - Azure Status [Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/azure-status-overview), Link to [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com/status/)
   This provides you with global status of azure services, also you can get info on service availability. This included all outage and upcoming planned maintenance activities and service advisories. 
   - The Service Health [Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/service-health-overview)
   This provides user a customized dashboard which tracks the health of your used services in azure portal. Using dashboard you can track events like, open/ongoing service issues, upcoming maintenance, relevant health advisories. When events become inactive they placed in health history for up to 90 days. Finally you can create managed alerts which will proactively notify when service issues are affecting your application. 
   - Resource Health [Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/resource-health-checks-resource-types)
   This can help you diagnose and get support for service problems that affect your Azure resource. Can report current and past health issues. Resource Health shows all the times that your resources have been unavailable because of Azure service problems. A resource is a specific instance of an Azure service, such as a virtual machine, web app, or SQL Database. Resource Health relies on signals from different Azure services to assess whether a resource is healthy. If a resource is unhealthy, Resource Health analyzes additional information to determine the source of the problem. It also reports on actions that Microsoft is taking to fix the problem and identifies things that you can do to address it.
   ![Health Monitor](./HealthMonitor.PNG)

   ###### Azure monitor
   This can also perform the same as above, however not on a resource group level. you have to select individual resources. Can view your resource logs.
   Logs can be generated based on some event not based on time. you can also monitor azure VMS. You can see network logs.

   ##### Azure Mobile app & Microsoft Remote desktop
   Can manage alerts and see subscription, resource group and resource health. One can stop start and monitor logs of azure vms. Also can login remotely using Microsoft Remote desktop app. Also can run Bash or Powershell cli commands on top of mobile app to manage resources. Also can change directories from left menu.
