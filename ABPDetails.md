# ABP Documentation [https://abp.io/](https://abp.io/)
ABP Framework offers an opinionated architecture to build enterprise software solutions with best practices on top of the .NET and the ASP.NET Core platforms. It provides the fundamental infrastructure, production-ready startup templates, modules, themes, tooling, guides and documentation to implement that architecture properly and automate the details and repetitive works as much as possible.

## Microservice Demo Solution
"Microservice are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservice architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservice-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment."
