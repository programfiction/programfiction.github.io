## Team Responsibility:
-	A solution/ project should compile well without error or warning. 
-	A program or a snippet is not complete, without developer-tested and unit tests cases.	
-	A complete documentation also crucial for a solution. 
-	A snippet is tidy (indentation, line length, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes, etc).
-	We have to consider proper use of exceptions handling using Middleware.
-	We have to impose appropriate use of logging	
-	Make sure unused imports/usings are removed
-	The code should follow Coding Standards c#9/latest	
-	Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?	
-	Are there any hardcoded, development only things still in the code?	
-	Solution should be platform independent
-	Security scan with any standard tool is must. E.g. veracode
-	Does the code release resources? (web connections, DataBase connection,static files)	
-	Corner cases well documented or any workaround for a known limitation of the frameworks
-	Can any code be replaced by calls to external reusable components or library functions?	
-	Design pattern need to take care of possible deadlocks. Use of CQRS

## Code reviewer pool responsibility:
-	Reviewer pool should review any code review in place single dev/ architect. 
-	Do not push empty files to Repository.
-	Do not push commented ts/js/css/html or any other file to Repository
-	Try to create small and frequent Pull requests to lower/staging environment in Repository.
-	Avoid using iFrames as it might create security concern.  In needed talk with architecture team
-	Each commit should have complete message with some standard across team.
    - e.g. Fix(Story number): description
    - e.g. Feature(Story number) : description
- Pull request/ code reviews should have complete comments related to change with story number starting with below initials 
	- build: change that effect system or external dependencies added
	- ci: Changes related CICD 
	- docs: adding some static documentation to project
	- feat: implementation of new feature
	- fix: Is a bug fix
	- perf: Code review that improves performance of project
	- refactor: refactoring redundant code
	- style: adding style to project
	- test: adding test case to project
- A code reviewer must make sure comments are comprehensible & neither numerous nor verbose.
- A code reviewer should find types are generalized where possible & parameterized types are used appropriately.
- A code reviewer also takes care of exceptions handling are proper or not. Also common error codes should return where needed with standard error format across project.
- Design should follow SOLID principle & Development standards.
    - A class should have single responsibility.
    - Methods should be short and defined appropriately in class using interface.
    -Repetitive code should be factored out. 
    - Naming convention should be standardized
    - Performance was considered during development
    - Code should not have unjustifiable method and code
- A code reviewer pool should standardize unit testing and should have a baseline 70~80 % of code coverage.
- Security concerns have been addressed.
- Logging implementation is also vital during code review to identify performance & issues.
